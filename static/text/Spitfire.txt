Supermarine Spitfire

“Spitfire, also called Supermarine Spitfire,  the most widely produced and strategically important British single-seat fighter of World War II. The Spitfire, renowned for winning victory laurels in the Battle of Britain (1940–41) along with the Hawker Hurricane, served in every theatre of the war and was produced in more variants than any other British aircraft.

“Faster than its formidable German opponent the Bf 109 at altitudes above 15,000 feet and just as maneuverable, Spitfires were sent by preference to engage German fighters while the slower Hurricanes went for the bombers. More Hurricanes than Spitfires served in the Battle of Britain, and they were credited with more ‘kills,’ but it can be argued that the Spitfire’s superior high-altitude performance provided the margin of victory.”*
