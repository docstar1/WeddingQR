SBD Dauntless

“In April 1939 orders were placed for 57 SBD-1s and 87 SBD-2s, the former for the Marines, the latter to go to the Navy. The SBD-2 had increased fuel capacity and was armed with two .30-in. machine guns in the engine cowling and either one or two .30-in. machine guns in the rear cockpit. By spring 1941, the SBD-3 appeared, incorporating self-sealing fuel tanks, extra armor and two .50-in. guns in the cowling. One important improvement was to the hydraulic system, improving dive brake operation. By December 1941, 584 SBD-3s had been sent to Navy and Marine squadrons.
“Capable of delivering a 1,000 lb. bomb, the SBD's steep dive bombing attack was devastating to ship targets, as was amply demonstrated during the Battle of Midway in June 1942. In a matter of minutes SBDs sank three Japanese carriers and heavily damaged a fourth that was attacked again and sunk the following day. Called the "Speedy Dee" by its pilots, the Dauntless established a reputation for ruggedness and reliability.”*
