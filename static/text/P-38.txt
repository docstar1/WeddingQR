P-38

The P-38 was a long-range heavy fighter used in the Pacific Theater in WWII, and was the aircraft of the top leading aces of the United States. The P-38 entered service in 1941. Over 10,000 were built, and only 6 are still flying today.

“First conceived in 1937 by Lockheed chief engineer Hall L. Hibbard and his then assistant, Clarence “Kelly” Johnson, the twin-boomed P-38 was the most innovative plane of its day, combining speed with unheard-of advances: two supercharged engines and a potent mix of four 50-caliber machine guns and a 20-mm cannon.

Upon its official introduction in 1940, the P-38 was capable of climbing to 3,300 feet in a single minute and reaching 400 mph, 100 mph faster than any other fighter in the world. It also doubled as an intimidating long-range threat, capable of carrying a larger payload than early B-17s and boasting a range of 1,150 miles.

Its versatility and ruggedness were legendary. It could sink a ship.  Strafed enemies on the ground. Crippled tanks. Destroyed entrenched pillboxes and shot down numerous fighters and bombers in all theaters of war.

When a long-range battle-tested airplane was needed for the Allies’ first round-trip mission to Berlin, a modified P-38 was chosen. And in 1943, when code breakers learned of a key inspection flight in the Pacific by Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, architect of the attack on U. S. installations in Hawaii, sixteen P-38 pilots were dispatched to fly a five-leg, nearly 1,000 mile-long mission.  

It proved to be a turning point in the war. After intercepting the admiral and his escort of Zero fighters, Japanese naval morale was crushed, and Allied morale soared. The intercept helped set the stage for an Allied victory in the Pacific.”

As a World War II fighter, the Lightning’s legacy is unmatched. A total of more than 10,000 P-38s—including 18 distinct models—were manufactured during the war, flying more than 130,000 missions in theaters around the world. P-38 pilots shot down more than Japanese aircraft than any other fighter and, as a reconnaissance aircraft, obtained 90 percent of the aerial film captured over Europe.

Perhaps Colonel Ben Kelsey, a P-38 test pilot, summed up the war bird’s legacy best of all. “(That) comfortable old cluck,” he said, “would fly like hell, fight like a wasp upstairs, and land like a butterfly.”*

49th Fighter Group, 5th Air Force; San Jose Airstrip San Leyte, Philippines

The United States Army Air Forces 49th Fighter Group of the 5th Air Force flew several different airplanes all around the pacific. At various points in its history, the 49th was equipped with Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, and Lockheed P-38 Lightnings, and stationed in places like Australia, New Guinea, and the Philippines. 

In late 1944, the 49th was equipped solely with P-38s, and based out of the Philippines. The unit included Maj. Richard Ira Bong, a pilot born and raised in northern Wisconsin who went on to be the leading US Ace with 40 victories. A P-38 painted like Maj Bong’s “Marge” is displayed in the Eagle Hangar here at the Museum. After the war, he worked as a test pilot at Lockheed’s Burbank CA plant flying the new P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter.

In more recent times, the 49th Fighter Group has become the 49th Operations Group, and has been home to F-117 Stealth fighters, and is currently flying F-22 Raptors out of Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.
